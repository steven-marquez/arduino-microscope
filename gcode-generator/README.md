### Overview

The GCODE Generator consists of the following parts:

* A Shared library where the basic generation code lives
* A Test Project for unit tests
* A CLI Project for generating gcode from the command line (eg, without internet)
* A HTML component for generating gcode from an embedded website.

Node.JS (10.16.3) is used.  This is the long term release.
